    "*Our goal is to accurately predict power output given a set of environmental readings from various sensors in a natural gas-fired power generation plant.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Background **\n",
    "\n",
    "Power generation is a complex process, and understanding and predicting power output is an important element in managing a plant and its connection to the power grid. The operators of a regional power grid create predictions of power demand based on historical information and environmental factors (e.g., temperature). They then compare the predictions against available resources (e.g., coal, natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro power plants). Power generation technologies such as solar and wind are highly dependent on environmental conditions, and all generation technologies are subject to planned and unplanned maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an real-world example of predicted demand (on two time scales), actual demand, and available resources from the California power grid: http://www.caiso.com/Pages/TodaysOutlook.aspx\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://content.caiso.com/outlook/SP/ems_small.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge for a power grid operator is how to handle a shortfall in available resources versus actual demand. There are three solutions to  a power shortfall: build more base load power plants (this process can take many years to decades of planning and construction), buy and import power from other regional power grids (this choice can be very expensive and is limited by the power transmission interconnects between grids and the excess power available from other grids), or turn on small [Peaker or Peaking Power Plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant). Because grid operators need to respond quickly to a power shortfall to avoid a power outage, grid operators rely on a combination of the last two choices. In this exercise, we'll focus on the last choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "** The Business Problem **\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they supply power only occasionally, the power supplied by a peaker power plant commands a much higher price per kilowatt hour than power from a power grid's base power plants. A peaker plant may operate many hours a day, or it may operate only a few hours per year, depending on the condition of the region's electrical grid. Because of the cost of building an efficient power plant, if a peaker plant is only going to be run for a short or highly variable time it does not make economic sense to make it as efficient as a base load power plant. In addition, the equipment and fuels used in base load plants are often unsuitable for use in peaker plants because the fluctuating conditions would severely strain the equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power output of a peaker power plant varies depending on environmental conditions, so the business problem is _predicting the power output of a peaker power plant as a function of the environmental conditions_ -- since this would enable the grid operator to make economic tradeoffs about the number of peaker plants to turn on (or whether to buy expensive power from another grid).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this business problem, we need to first perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and then translate the business problem (predicting power output as a function of envionmental conditions) into a Machine Learning task.  In this instance, the ML task is regression since the label (or target) we are trying to predict is numeric. We will use an [Apache Spark ML Pipeline](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark-ml-package) to perform the regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real-world data we are using in this notebook consists of 9,568 data points, each with 4 environmental attributes collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), and is provided by the University of California, Irvine at [UCI Machine Learning Repository Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant).

In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models.\n",

    "Linear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:\n",
    "  - If the goal is prediction, or forecasting, or error reduction, linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed data set of \\\\(y\\\\) and \\\\(X\\\\) values. After developing such a model, if an additional value of \\\\(X\\\\) is then given without its accompanying value of \\\\(y\\\\), the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the value of \\\\(y\\\\).\n",
    "  - Given a variable \\\\(y\\\\) and a number of variables \\\\( X_1 \\\\), ..., \\\\( X_p \\\\) that may be related to \\\\(y\\\\), linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between \\\\(y\\\\) and the \\\\( X_j\\\\), to assess which \\\\( X_j \\\\) may have no relationship with \\\\(y\\\\) at all, and to identify which subsets of the \\\\( X_j \\\\) contain redundant information about \\\\(y\\\\).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a model with all of the data let's try to make a better model by tuning over several parameters. The process of tuning a model is known as [Model Selection](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#module-pyspark.ml.tuning) or [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#module-pyspark.ml.tuning), and Spark ML Pipeline makes the tuning process very simple and easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task in ML is model selection, or using data to find the best model or parameters for a given task. This is also called tuning. Tuning may be done for individual Estimators such as [LinearRegression](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/ml-classification-regression.html#linear-regression), or for entire Pipelines which include multiple algorithms, featurization, and other steps. Users can tune an entire Pipeline at once, rather than tuning each element in the Pipeline separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark ML Pipeline supports model selection using tools such as [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator), which requires the following items:\n",
    "  - [Estimator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.Estimator): algorithm or Pipeline to tune\n",
    "  - [Set of ParamMaps](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.ParamGridBuilder): parameters to choose from, sometimes called a _parameter grid_ to search over\n",
    "  - [Evaluator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.evaluation.Evaluator): metric to measure how well a fitted Model does on held-out test data\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, model selection tools such as [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator) work as follows:\n",
    "  - They split the input data into separate training and test datasets.\n",
    "  - For each (training, test) pair, they iterate through the set of ParamMaps:\n",
    "    - For each [ParamMap](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.ParamGridBuilder), they fit the [Estimator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.Estimator) using those parameters, get the fitted Model, and evaluate the Model's performance using the [Evaluator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.evaluation.Evaluator).\n",
    "  - They select the Model produced by the best-performing set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Evaluator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.evaluation.Evaluator) can be a [RegressionEvaluator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.evaluation.RegressionEvaluator) for regression problems. To help construct the parameter grid, users can use the [ParamGridBuilder](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.ParamGridBuilder) utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that cross-validation over a grid of parameters is expensive. For example, in the next cell, the parameter grid has 10 values for [lr.regParam](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.regression.LinearRegression.regParam), and [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator) uses 3 folds. This multiplies out to (10 x 3) = 30 different models being trained. In realistic settings, it can be common to try many more parameters (e.g., multiple values for multiple parameters) and use more folds (_k_ = 3 and _k_ = 10 are common). In other words, using [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator) can be very expensive. However, it is also a well-established method for choosing parameters which is more statistically sound than heuristic hand-tuning.\n",

    "  - Use [ParamGridBuilder](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.ParamGridBuilder) to build a parameter grid with the regularization parameters and add the grid to the [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator)\n",
    "  - Run the [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator) to find the parameters that yield the best model (i.e., lowest RMSE) and return the best model.\n",
